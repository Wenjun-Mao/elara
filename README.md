# elara
A Docker image based on the jupyter-docker-stacks `scipy-notebook` image, which is itself based
on the `minimal-notebook` image, which is itself based on the `base-notebook` image. This repo and project
is named after Elara, a prograde irregular satellite of the planet Jupiter. 

See https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks for each image's dockerfile.

This image adds a number of additional packages including 
[nbgrader](https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader) 
and [rise](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE).

## Generate image
Build the image. Note the trailing ".". Flags:
* -f &minus; path to file.
* -t &minus; tag name.

```cmd
docker build -f ./Dockerfile -t jpyedu-scipy:latest .
```

## Run image in new container (JupyterLab)
Run the image, invoking the JupyterLab interface. Flags:
* --rm &minus; automatically clean up the container and remove the file system when the container exits. 
Also removes anonymous volumes associated with the container.
* -p &minus; set the local port to 8888 and the container port to 8888 (required).
* -v &minus; bind local volume (name or abs path) to container volume (abs path). 
* -e &minus; sets an environment variable (in this case, launching the JupyterLab interface).
* --name &minus; set local container name.

```cmd
docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -v /Users/arwhyte/Development/repos/github/arwhyte/notebooks:/home/jovyan/work -e JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes --name jupyter_lab jpyedu-scipy
```

## Run image in new container (Jupyter notebook classic)
Run the image, invoking the classic Jupyter notebook interface. Other flags:
* --rm &minus; automatically clean up the container and remove the file system when the container exits. 
Also removes anonymous volumes associated with the container.
* -p &minus; set the local port to 8888 and the container port to 8888 (required).
* -v &minus; bind local volume (name or abs path) to container volume (abs path). 
* --name &minus; set local container name.

```cmd
docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -v /Users/arwhyte/Development/repos/github/arwhyte/notebooks:/home/jovyan/work --name jupyter_notebook jpyedu-scipy
```

## Remove containers

:warning: Docker containers are automatically removed when you stop them if you start the container 
using the `--rm` flag (as above.

```commandline
$ docker container ls -a

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
e65a3686df04        jpyedu-scipy        "tini -g -- start-noâ€¦"   6 minutes ago       Up 6 minutes        0.0.0.0:8888->8888/tcp   jupyter_notebook

$ docker stop e65a3686df04
$ docker rm e65a3686df04    
```

## Dockerfile

Image based on Jupyter Docker Stacks 
[jupyter/scipy-notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/scipy-notebook) which, in turn, is based on the jupyter/minimal-notebook.
